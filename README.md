The **Parking Space Detection System** is designed to automatically detect and identify available parking spaces using images from security cameras. The system uses a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to detect vehicles and match them to predefined parking spaces. This can help optimize parking space usage and provide real-time data on available spots.

## Features
- Vehicle Detection: Uses a pre-trained Mask R-CNN model to detect cars and trucks in parking lots.
- Parking Spot Assignment: Matches detected vehicles to predefined parking spaces based on overlap.
- Occupancy Visualization: Generates a visual overlay showing occupied and vacant spots.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Torch (PyTorch)
- Pillow (PIL)
- Torchvision
- NumPy
- Pickle
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- OpenCV
